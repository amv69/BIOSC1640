        <p>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>
        <p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. You can do anything your heart can imagine. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.</p>
